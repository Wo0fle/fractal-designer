## Stuff to be added:

* zoom, translate, and rotate viewport, and change variables from inside the program (duh)
* parametrize variables from inside the program (duh)
* parametrize exponent
* implement Lyapunov exponent instead of escape time algorithm
* smooth rotation between viewing the z, c, and x sets (will require lots of crazy vector math probably)
* more color options (more color stops, custom color for points inside the set, anything else I can think of)
* add more types of fractals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
