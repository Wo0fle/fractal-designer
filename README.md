## Stuff to be added:

* zoom, translate, and rotate viewport, and change variables from inside the program (duh)
* parametrize variables from inside the program (duh)
* implement Lyapunov exponent instead of escape time algorithm
* smooth rotation between viewing the z, c, and x sets (will require lots of crazy vector math probably)
* more color options (more color stops mainly, but also anything else I can think of)
* custom fractal equations (with presets such as Burning Ships, [Payne's Bowls](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/s/WsDKkJfor6), etc.)
